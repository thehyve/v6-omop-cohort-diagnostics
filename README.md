# OMOP Cohort Diagnostics
This algorithm is part of the [vantage6](https://vantage6.ai) solution.
Vantage6 allows to execute computations on federated datasets. This repository
contains the [OHDSI Cohort Diagnostics](https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortDiagnostics/)
algorithm.

This package has been developed in context of the
[BlueBerry](https://euracan.eu/registries/blueberry/) project.

## Adapted implementation
Please note: this version was adapted for use with a custom installation of Vantage6 (see the [Vantage6 deployment project](https://github.com/thehyve/vantage6-deployment).
For this installation, the notes below may apply.

### vantage6 server API & credentials in `client.py`
By default, the `client.py` scripts connects to the Vantage6 server instance as created by the test script in the [Vantage6 deployment project](https://github.com/thehyve/vantage6-deployment).
The server and related settings can be overridden by the following environment variables: `V6_API_URL, V6_API_PORT, V6_API_PATH, V6_API_USER, V6_API_PASSWORD`

### Self-signed certificates
If you want to start this algorithm by running `client.py` and your installation uses self-signed certificates, you need to make sure the environment variable `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`
points to your certificate file, e.g. `export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/home/usr/path/to/cert.pem`

### Collaboration, organizations
Make sure that the collaboration and organization ids in `client.py` match your configuration:
```python
task = client.task.create(
    collaboration=1,
    organizations=[2],
```

### Minimum cell count
The minimum cell count for fields contains person counts or fractions. This is identical to the `minCellCount` parameter in the OHDSI package. You can set it using `CD_MIN_RECORDS`.

## Build
In order to build its best to use the makefile.

```bash
make image VANTAGE6_VERSION=4.10.2
```

## Node configuration
In order for this algorithm to run the vantage6 node needs to be properly
configured:

1. The algorithm containers need to be able to connect to the OMOP database.
   This seems trivial, but it is not as algorithm containers are completely
    isolated from the host machine.
2. The node configuration file needs to supply several additional parameters
   in order for the algorithm to create a connection to the OMOP database.

### 1. Attach OMOP database to the internal vantage6 network

#### Attach Docker container to the network
The easiest way is to attach the OMOP database container to the vantage6
network by adding the `docker_services` section in the node configuration file:

```yaml
# Containers that are defined here are linked to the algorithm containers and
# can therefore be accessed when by the algorithm when it is running. Note that
# for using this option, the container with 'container_name' should already be
# started before the node is started.
docker_services:
  container_label: container_name
```

Important to note is that this OMOP container should already be running prior
node start up.

#### Configure SSH tunnel to the Docker host
The second option is to configure an SSH tunnel to the Docker host. In this
case the OMOP database needs to listen on some port on the host machine. This
can either be in a Docker container or on the host machine itself. This can be
done by adding the `ssh_tunnel` section to the node configuration file:

```yaml
# Create SSH Tunnel to connect algorithms to external data sources. The
# `hostname` and `tunnel:bind:port` can be used by the algorithm
# container to connect to the external data source. This is the address
# you need to use in the `databases` section of the configuration file!
ssh-tunnels:

  # Hostname to be used within the internal network. I.e. this is the
  # hostname that the algorithm uses to connect to the data source. Make
  # sure this is unique and the same as what you specified in the
  # `databases` section of the configuration file.
  - hostname: my-data-source

    # SSH configuration of the remote machine
    ssh:

      # Hostname or ip of the remote machine, in case it is the docker
      # host you can use `host.docker.internal` for Windows and MacOS.
      # In the case of Linux you can use `172.17.0.1` (the ip of the
      # docker bridge on the host)
      host: host.docker.internal
      port: 22

      # fingerprint of the remote machine. This is used to verify the
      # authenticity of the remote machine.
      fingerprint: "ssh-rsa ..."

      # Username and private key to use for authentication on the remote
      # machine
      identity:
        username: username
        key: /path/to/private_key.pem

      # Once the SSH connection is established, a tunnel is created to
      # forward traffic from the local machine to the remote machine.
      tunnel:

        # The port and ip on the tunnel container. The ip is always
        # 0.0.0.0 as we want the algorithm container to be able to
        # connect.
        bind:
          ip: 0.0.0.0
          port: 8000

        # The port and ip on the remote machine. If the data source runs
        # on this machine, the ip most likely is 127.0.0.1.
        dest:
          ip: 127.0.0.1
          port: 8000
```

### 2. Add OMOP database to the node configuration file
The second step is to add the OMOP database to the node configuration file.
This can be done by adding the `databases` section to the node configuration
file:

```yaml
databases:
  - label: omop
    uri: jdbc:postgresql://[OMOP_HOSTNAME]:5454/postgres
    # Additional environment variables that are passed to the algorithm
    # containers (or their wrapper). This can be used to for usernames
    # and passwords for example. Note that these environment variables are
    # only passed to the algorithm container when the user requests that
    # database. In case you want to pass some environment variable to all
    # algorithms regard less of the data source the user specifies you can
    # use the `algorithm_env` setting.
    env:
      user: admin@admin.com
      password: admin
      dbms: postgresql
      cdm_database: postgres
      cdm_schema: public
      results_schema: results
```

The `env` section contains database specific parameters. The `dbms` parameter
is used to determine which database driver to use. The `cdm_database` and
`cdm_schema` parameters are used to determine which database and schema are
used for the OMOP CDM. The `results_schema` parameter is used to determine
which schema is used to store the results of the algorithm.

Make sure that the `uri` contains the correct `OMOP_HOSTNAME`, this depends on
wether you attached the OMOP database to the internal vantage6 network or
configured an SSH tunnel to the Docker host. In case you used the internal
vantage6 network, the `OMOP_HOSTNAME` is the same as the `container_label`. In
case you configured an SSH tunnel, the `OMOP_HOSTNAME` is the same as the
`hostname` in the `ssh-tunnels` section.


## Client / Usage
Make sure you have installed the vantage6 client, if you are unfamiliar with
the vantage6 client please read the
[documentation](https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/user/pyclient.html).

Lets first authenticate with the server:

```python
client = Client('http://127.0.0.1', 5000, '/api', log_level='debug')
client.authenticate('username', '***')

# insert the private key of your organization, only if the collaboration you
# are working in is encrypted.
client.setup_encryption(None)
```

Then we need to load the cohort definitions. In this example we used `*.json`
cohorts defined in the `local/` folder in this repository. These definitions
can be created and exported from the OHDSI
[ATLAS](https://github.com/OHDSI/Atlas) tool.

```python
# Load the cohort definitions from a folder. These can be created using the
# ATLAS tool
folder_ = Path(r".\local")
files = list(folder_.glob('*.json'))
omop_jsons = [(folder_ / file_).read_text() for file_ in files]
names = [file_.stem for file_ in files]
```

Then we define the
[python-ohdsi](https://python-ohdsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) function
arguments. For details on the arguments see the OHDSI documentation.

```python
# Create covariate settings
# To see all the available options please refer to the documentation of the
# OHDSI package: https://ohdsi.github.io/FeatureExtraction/reference/createTemporalCovariateSettings.html.
# Note that all arguments are converted from camelCase to snake_case

    'temporal_start_days': [
        # components displayed in cohort characterization
        -9999,  # anytime prior
        -365,  # long term prior
        -180,  # medium term prior

        0,  # index date only
        1,  # 1 day after to day 30
        31,
        -9999  # any time prior to any time future
    ],
    'temporal_end_days': [
        0,  # anytime prior

        0,  # index date only
        30,  # 1 day after to day 30
        365,
        9999  # any time prior to any time future
    ]
}

# Execute cohort diagnostics settings
# To see all the available options please refer to the documentation of the
# OHDSI package: https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortDiagnostics/reference/executeDiagnostics.html
diagnostics_settings = {
    'run_inclusion_statistics': True,
    'run_included_source_concepts': True,
    'run_orphan_concepts': True,
    'run_time_series': False,
    'run_visit_context': True,
    'run_breakdown_index_events': False,
    'run_incidence_rate': True,
    'run_cohort_relationship': True,
    'run_temporal_cohort_characterization': True
}
```

Then we can create the task and submit it to the server:

```python
# Create the task
# Create a new vantage6 task that executes the cohort diagnostics at all the
# nodes that are part of the collaboration.
task = client.task.create(
    collaboration=1,
    organizations=[1],
    name='omop-test',
    description='@',
    input_={
        'method': 'central',
        'kwargs': {
            'cohort_definitions': omop_jsons,
            'cohort_names': names,
            'temporal_covariate_settings': temporal_covariate_settings,
            'diagnostics_settings': diagnostics_settings,
        }
    },
    databases=[{'label': 'default'}],
    image=****
)
```

Finally we can await and collect the results by:

```python
# Wait for the results
task_id = task.get('id')
results = client.wait_for_results(task_id=task_id)
```
